Hi everyone, I just wanted to share a little story from my meeting. So I went to the park with some friends and we tried this new ice cream juice. I see it was amazing, the flavors were crazy, like chocolate, bacon and mango chili. I wasn't sure about it at first, but I actually tasted really good. After that, we just walked around to listen to the music and chat about random stuff. Funny means TV shows and even some silly personal stories. It's very exciting really relaxing to just hand around and laugh out without worrying about anything serious.
